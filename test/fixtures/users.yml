# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

one:
  name: example1
  email: example1@example.com
  encrypted_password: <%= User.new.send(:password_digest, '123456') %>
two:
  name: example2
